1. Strace of ./a binary initially shows that it tries to open a file called ./pesho in read-only mode and fails with segmentation fault.
2. Providing an empty file fixes the segmentation fault. The program tries to read the first 1024 bytes and exits successfully with no output.
3. Providing a file "pesho" with the text "test" causes a malloc assertion error, indicating issues with memory management / validation.
4. Providing file b as "pesho" causes the program to finish successfully. Based on the output, it appears to print the byte number and its signed char (1-byte) value each on separate line.
5. Finally, running ./a through Valgrind reveals some additional problems related to variable initialization.
